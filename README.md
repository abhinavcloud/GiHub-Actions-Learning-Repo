# 🚀 Build and Deploy Static Website via AWS S3 using GitHub Actions

This repository demonstrates a **complete CI/CD pipeline** for building, testing, and deploying a static website to **Amazon S3** using **GitHub Actions**.

We are not just deploying a website — we are learning:

- ✅ How to structure multi-job workflows  
- ✅ How to enforce quality gates (lint → test → build → deploy)  
- ✅ How to use reusable workflows  
- ✅ How to build a custom JavaScript GitHub Action  
- ✅ How to deploy static assets to  S3  
- ✅ How to manage secrets securely  
- ✅ How to pass artifacts between jobs  
- ✅ How to expose outputs across workflows

# 🧠 What We Are Building

We are creating a **production-grade CI/CD pipeline** that:

1. Runs lint checks  
2. Runs automated tests  
3. Builds the project  
4. Uploads build artifacts  
5. Calls a reusable workflow  
6. Authenticates with AWS  
7. Deploys files to an S3 bucket  
8. Prints the live static website URL  


---

# ⚙️ Workflow 1: Main CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
name: Build and deploy Static Website via AWS S3

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

```

Triggered on push to:

- `main`

# 🏗 Job 1: Lint

## Purpose:
Ensure code quality before anything else runs.

## What Happens:

1. Prints job-level secret (`ENV_OWNER`)  
2. Checks out repository  
3. Installs dependencies (with caching)  
4. Runs lint  

## What We Learn:

- How job-level secrets work  
- Using `actions/checkout`  
- Creating reusable local composite actions  
- Dependency caching using `hashFiles()`  
- Enforcing quality gates early  

## Why It Matters:

Fail fast → Save build minutes → Improve code standards  

---

# 🧪 Job 2: Test

```yaml
needs: lint
```

## Purpose:
Run automated tests only if lint passes.

## What Happens:

1. Checkout code  
2. Install dependencies  
3. Run `npm run test`  
4. Upload `test.json` if tests fail  

## Key Feature:

```yaml
if: failure() && steps.test-code-step.outcome == 'failure'
```

This condition ensures test reports upload **only when tests fail**.

## What We Learn:

- Job dependencies (`needs`)  
- Step IDs  
- Conditional execution  
- Uploading artifacts (`actions/upload-artifact`)  
- Failure-aware pipelines  

---

# 🏗 Job 3: Build

```yaml
needs: test
if: always() && (failure() || needs.test.result == 'success')
```

## Purpose:
Build project even if test fails — useful for debugging artifacts.

## What Happens:

1. Checkout  
2. Install dependencies  
3. Run `npm run build`  
4. Upload `dist/*` as artifact (`dist-files`)  

## What We Learn:

- Advanced conditional expressions  
- Using `always()`  
- Artifact persistence between jobs  
- Ensuring build output exists (`if-no-files-found: error`)  

---

# 🚀 Job 4: Deploy (Reusable Workflow)

Instead of writing deployment logic again, we use:

```yaml
uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable_workflow.yml
```

## Why Reusable Workflows?

- DRY principle  
- Share deployment logic across repositories  
- Clean separation of CI and CD  

## Inputs Passed:

- Cache path  
- Cache key  
- Artifact name  
- Artifact path  
- S3 bucket  
- AWS region  

## Secrets:

```yaml
secrets: inherit
```

Allows secure access to:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`  
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`  

---

# 📦 Workflow 2: Reusable Deployment Workflow

```yaml
name: reusable-workflow-deploy

on:
  workflow_call:
```

This workflow:

- Accepts inputs  
- Exposes outputs  
- Deploys to AWS  

---

# 🔁 Reusable Job: reusbale-deploy

## Step 1 — Checkout Code

Standard repo checkout.

---

## Step 2 — Install Cached Dependencies

Reuses local composite caching action.

---

## Step 3 — Download Build Artifacts

```yaml
uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
```

Downloads `dist-files` into deployment folder.

---

## Step 4 — Configure AWS Credentials

```yaml
uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
```

Authenticates securely with AWS.

This allows use of:

- AWS CLI  
- S3 commands  
- Infrastructure tools  

---

## Step 5 — Custom JavaScript Action (Advanced)

```yaml
uses: ./.github/actions/deploy-s3-javascript
```

Instead of directly running AWS CLI in YAML, we built a **custom GitHub Action using Node.js**.

---

# 🛠 Custom GitHub Action

## action.yml

```yaml
name: Deploy to AWS S3
description: Deploy a Static Website via AWS S3

runs:
  using: node20
  main: dist/index.js
```

This tells GitHub:

- Use Node 20 runtime  
- Execute compiled JavaScript  

---

## main.js Logic

```js
const core = require('@actions/core');
const exec = require('@actions/exec');

async function run() {
  try {
    const bucket = core.getInput('bucket', { required: true });
    const region = core.getInput('region', { required: true });
    const dist_folder = core.getInput('dist_folder', { required: true });

    const s3url = `s3://${bucket}`;

    await exec.exec(
      `aws s3 sync ${dist_folder} ${s3url} --region ${region}`
    );

    core.notice('S3 sync completed successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run();
```

## What It Does:

- Takes inputs  
- Runs `aws s3 sync`  
- Syncs local build folder with S3 bucket  

## What We Learn:

- Creating JavaScript-based actions  
- Using `@actions/core`  
- Using `@actions/exec`  
- Running shell commands programmatically  
- Error handling with `core.setFailed()`  
- Writing production-ready reusable actions  

---

# 🌍 Deployment Target: Amazon S3 Static Hosting

We deploy to:

```
http://<bucket>.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
```

S3 is used as:

- Object storage  
- Static hosting platform  
- Global content delivery base  

## Why S3?

- Highly scalable  
- Low cost  
- Reliable  
- Perfect for static sites  

---

# 🔗 Passing Outputs Between Workflows

Reusable workflow exposes:

```yaml
outputs:
  site-url:
```

Main workflow prints it:

```yaml
${{needs.deploy.outputs.site-url}}
```

## What We Learn:

- Job outputs  
- Workflow outputs  
- Cross-workflow communication  
- Pipeline orchestration  

---

# 🔐 Secrets & Security

Stored in GitHub:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`  
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`  

Accessed via:

```yaml
${{secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}
```

## Security Concepts Learned:

- Secret inheritance  
- Environment variables  
- Avoiding credential leaks  
- Secure authentication patterns  

---

# 🧩 Caching Strategy

We cache:

```
~/.npm
```

Using:

```yaml
hashFiles('**/package-lock.json')
```

## Why?

- Faster builds  
- Reduced CI time  
- Efficient dependency restoration  

---

# 📦 Artifact Strategy

We upload:

- Test reports (on failure)  
- Build files (`dist-files`)  

Artifacts allow:

- Debugging  
- Cross-job data transfer  
- Deployment separation
